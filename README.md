# Rock Paper Scissors - JavaScript Console Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors built using JavaScript. The game is played in the browser console, where a human player competes against the computer over five rounds. The game logic, including random choice generation for the computer and user input handling, is coded from scratch to showcase basic JavaScript functionality.

## Installation:
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors-console.git`
- Open the index.html file in your browser to start the game in the console.

## How to Play:
- When prompted, type `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` in the console.
- The computer randomly picks one of the three choices and the round winner is displayed.
- The game proceeds for 5 rounds, and the final score is shown at the end.

## Features:
- Random choice generation for the computer.
- Player input handling with prompt.
- Displays a round winner and the final score after 5 rounds.

## Usage Example:
Hereâ€™s what you will see in the console while playing the game:
```
You chose Rock!
Computer chose Scissors!
You win! Rock beats Scissors.

Round 1: You win! Current score - Player: 1, Computer: 0

You chose Paper!
Computer chose Rock!
You win! Paper beats Rock.

Round 2: You win! Current score - Player: 2, Computer: 0
...
```
