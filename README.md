# Rock Paper Scissors - JavaScript Console Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors built using JavaScript. The game is played in the browser console, where a human player competes against the computer over five rounds. The game logic, including random choice generation for the computer and user input handling, is coded from scratch to showcase basic JavaScript functionality.
